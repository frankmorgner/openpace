*******************************************************************************
Download OpenPACE
*******************************************************************************

You can download the latest release of OpenPACE on `Github
<https://github.com/frankmorgner/openpace/releases/latest>`_. Older releases
are still available on `Sourceforge
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/openpace/files>`_.

If you plan to make contribution, you can clone our git repository to later
make a pull request on Github::

    git clone https://github.com/frankmorgner/openpace.git

Alternatively, the current developement version is available as `zip file
<https://github.com/frankmorgner/openpace/archive/master.zip>`_ or as
precompiled Windows `32 bit binaries
<https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/frankmorgner/openpace/artifacts/openpace_win32-vs14-python3.zip?branch=master&job=Environment:%20VSVER=14;%20Platform:%20x86>`_
and `64 bit binaries
<https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/frankmorgner/openpace/artifacts/openpace_win64-vs14-python3.zip?branch=master&job=Environment:%20VSVER=14;%20Platform:%20x64>`_.

The Windows binaries are created in the CI environment of AppVeyor, using its
currently installed build tools of the [Visual Studio 2015 worker
image](https://www.appveyor.com/docs/windows-images-software/). The build
script invokes installation of additional components via [MSYS2's
pacman](https://github.com/frankmorgner/openpace/blob/master/appveyor.yml). If
you require supply chain security, we recommend to compile the software from
source (see below).



*******************************************************************************
Compiling and Installing OpenPACE
*******************************************************************************


==================================================
Setting up a development environment using Vagrant
==================================================

The easiest way to setup a development or test environment is to use Vagrant_ with VirtualBox_.
OpenPACE comes with a Vagrantfile which lets you setup a working
environment with just one command. To create a Ubuntu based virtual machine,
install all dependencies and compile OpenPACE, run the following command
in the OpenPACE directory::

   vagrant up

You then need to ``vagrant ssh`` in order to access the VM. The
:file:`openpace` folder is shared between the host and the VM so any
changes you make on the host are immediately visible in the VM and vice versa.


====================================
Compiling on Linux, Unix and similar
====================================

OpenPACE uses the GNU Build System to compile and install. If you are
unfamiliar with it, please have a look at :file:`INSTALL`. If you can not find
it, you are probably working bleeding edge in the repository.  Run the
following command in :file:`openpace` to get the missing standard
auxiliary files::
    
    autoreconf --verbose --install

To configure (``./configure --help`` lists possible options), build and
install OpenPACE now do the following::

    ./configure
    make
    make install

OpenPACE depends on the OpenSSL_ library. Since |PACE| uses CMAC and the
Brainpool curves, OpenSSL is required with version 1.0.2 or later.

Furthermore, additional object identifiers from `BSI TR-03110`_ are required.
You have two options to get them to work:

1. Let OpenPACE load the object identifiers at runtime
2. Patch OpenSSL to include the identifiers

The first option allows you to install an unchanged version of OpenSSL to your
system. However, performance will be slightly worse and there are some
limitations. For example, you won't be able to use the new NIDs as labels in a
switch statement and you need to make sure to call ``EAC_init()`` first.  For
patching OpenSSL we provide :file:`bsi_objects.txt`. You can configure
OpenPACE with :option:`--enable-openssl-install`, which will
automatically download, patch, build and install OpenSSL if needed.

The language bindings for Python, Java, ... are currently disabled by default.
You need to explicitely configure OpenPACE to install them by using
:option:`--enable-python`, :option:`--enable-java`, ... This requires SWIG to
be installed along with the language's toolchain to build the bindings.


=====================
Compiling for Windows
=====================

Compiling with Visual Studio
----------------------------

.. highlight:: bat

A quick and dirty way without
wasting too much time on setting up the development environment would be to
compile the library by hand in the :menuselection:`Visual Studio Tools -->
Developer Command Prompt` with installed `OpenSSL Windows binaries`_:

.. literalinclude:: ./../../appveyor.yml
    :lines: 69-79

The setup of the environment variables can be found in our `Windows CI script
<https://github.com/frankmorgner/openpace/blob/master/appveyor.yml#L7-L47>`_
which includes all steps of this procedure.

Compiling the Python Bindings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Again, without further ado, we compile the bindings with the Developer Command
prompt with installed `Python`_:

.. literalinclude:: ./../../appveyor.yml
    :lines: 81-85

The setup of the environment variables can be found in our `Windows CI script
<https://github.com/frankmorgner/openpace/blob/master/appveyor.yml#L7-L47>`_
which includes all steps of this procedure.
