OpenPACE implements Extended Access Control (EAC) version 2 as specified in
`BSI TR-03110`_. OpenPACE comprises support for the following protocols:

:Password Authenticated Connection Establishment (PACE):
    Establish a secure channel with a strong key between two parties that only
    share a weak secret.
:Terminal Authentication (TA):
    Verify/prove the terminal's certificate (or rather certificate chain) and
    secret key.
:Chip Authentication (CA):
    Establish a secure channel based on the chip's static key pair proving its
    authenticy.

Furthermore, OpenPACE also supports Card Verifiable Certificates (CV
Certificates) as well as easy to use wrappers for using the established secure
channels.

The handlers for looking up trust anchors during |TA| and |CA| (i.e. the |CVCA|
and the |CSCA| certificates) can be customized. By default, the appropriate
certificates will be looked up in the file system.

OpenPACE supports all variants of |PACE| (DH/ECDH, GM/IM), |TA|
(RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5/RSASSA-PSS/ECDSA), |CA| (DH/ECDH) and all standardized
domain parameters (GFP/ECP).
   

OpenPACE is implemented as C-library and comes with native language wrappers
for:

- Python
- Ruby
- Javascript
- Java
- Go

.. note::
    OpenPACE only implements the cryptographic protocols of the |EAC|. If you
    actually want to exchange data with a smart card, you need to take care of
    formatting and sending the data in the form of APDUs. If this is what
    you're trying to do, you should have a look at the :command:`npa-tool` of
    the `nPA Smart Card Library`_.


*******************************************************************************
Download OpenPACE
*******************************************************************************

You can find the latest release of OpenPACE on `Sourceforge
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/openpace/>`_.

Alternatively, you can clone our git repository::

    git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/openpace/git openpace


*******************************************************************************
Install OpenPACE
*******************************************************************************

OpenPACE uses the GNU Build System to compile and install. If you are
unfamiliar with it, please have a look at :file:`INSTALL`. If you can not find
it, you are probably working bleeding edge in the repository.  Run the
following command in :file:`openpace` to get the missing standard
auxiliary files::
    
    autoreconf --verbose --install

To configure (:command:`configure --help` lists possible options), build and
install OpenPACE now do the following::

    ./configure
    make
    make install

OpenPACE depends on the `OpenSSL`_ library. Since |PACE| uses CMAC and the
Brainpool curves, the currently unreleased version 1.0.2 of OpenSSL is required.

Furthermore, additional object identifiers from `BSI TR-03110`_ are required.
You have two options to get them to work:

1. Let OpenPACE load the object identifiers at runtime
2. Patch OpenSSL to include the identifiers

The first option allows you to install an unchanged version of OpenSSL to your
system. However, performance will be slightly worse and there are some
limitations. For example, you won't be able to use the new NIDs as labels in a
switch statement and you need to make sure to call ``EAC_init()`` first.  For
patching OpenSSL we provide :file:`oids.patch`. You can configure
OpenPACE with :option:`--enable-openssl-install`, which will
automatically download, patch, build and install OpenSSL if needed.

===============================================================================
Cross compiling OpenPACE
===============================================================================

We have added some scripts for the ease of cross compiling for Windows and
Android. Both are tested with Debian wheezy. First create a working
:file:`Makefile`::

    test -x configure || autoreconf --verbose --install
    ./configure

Compiling for Windows
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cross compilation for Windows can be done with::

    make win

================ ==================== ===========================================================================================
Make Variable    Default              Meaning
================ ==================== ===========================================================================================
``WIN_TOOL``     ``i686-w64-mingw32`` cross compiler
``WIN_TOOL_DIR`` ``/usr/${WIN_TOOL}`` root directory of the cross compiler containing the :file:`lib` and :file:`include` folders
================ ==================== ===========================================================================================

On successfull compilation, the Windows binaries can be found in
:file:`openpace-0.9_win32`.

Compiling for Android
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cross compilation for Android can be done with::

    make android

============================= ============================================================================== =====================================================
Make Variable                 Default                                                                        Meaning
============================= ============================================================================== =====================================================
``ANDROID_ARCH``              ``arm``                                                                        target Architecture
``ANDROID_TOOL``              ``${ANDROID_ARCH}-linux-androideabi``                                          cross compiler
``MAKE_STANDALONE_TOOLCHAIN`` ``${HOME}/.local/opt/android-ndk-r9/build/tools/make-standalone-toolchain.sh`` location of the NDK script for creating the toolchain
============================= ============================================================================== =====================================================

On successfull compilation, the Android binaries can be found in
:file:`openpace-0.9_${ANDROID_ARCH}`.

.. _javascript_api:

Compiling for Javascript
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Technically the process for getting OpenPACE into Javascript is similar to
cross compiling. With Emscripten_ the library is compiled into LLVM bytecode
and then translated into Javascript. Use the following command::

    make emscripten

============================= ================================== ==============================================================================
Make Variable                 Default                            Meaning
============================= ================================== ==============================================================================
``EMSCRIPTEN_DIR``            ``${HOME}/.local/src/emscripten``  root directory of emscripten containing the :file:`system/include/libc` folder
============================= ================================== ==============================================================================

On successfull compilation, the compiled bitcode files can be found in
:file:`openpace-0.9_bc`. You can run our testsuite
completely in Javascript or `in your browser <../../_static/eactest.html>`_::

    nodejs openpace-0.9_bc/eactest.js
    # WARNING: Our tests are very time consuming and might stall your browser for a moment or two...
    firefox openpace-0.9_bc/eactest.html

.. warning::
    `Javascript cryptography is considered harmful`_. You may want to think
    twice before using the Javascript version of OpenPACE.


*******************************************************************************
How to use OpenPACE
*******************************************************************************

OpenPACE is a native C library on top of OpenSSL. If you want to know how to
use OpenPACE from C/C++, have a look at our `API documentation
<../../_static/doxygen/modules.html>`_.

OpenPACE uses SWIG_ to offer bindings in some more programming languages. The
bindings are easily portable to lots of different languages. Currently, native
language bindings need to be explicitly turned on with ``./configure
--enable-...``

If you have chosen to install OpenPACE in a non-standard location you have to
set up the :envvar:`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable correctly. One way to
do this is::

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/path/to/libeac

If OpenPACE is compiled for Javascript, it results in a standalone Javascript
file that can be used without special requirements.
